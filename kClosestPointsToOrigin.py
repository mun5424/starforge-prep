"""
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

2 answers: 

1. keep a priority queue that has K closest points to the origin.
2. keep a list of the points with their sorted distances and return the top K

solution #1 sounds much more viable than 2 using less space O(k) over O(N)
